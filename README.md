Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Ben Angelo, and I'm currently on a journey to learn data analysis.
While I don't have any projects to showcase just yet, I'm excited to share my progress and learning experiences with you.

## About Me

I'm passionate about exploring and analyzing data to uncover insights and make informed decisions. 
This repository serves as a space for me to document my learning, share resources, and connect with the data analysis community.

## Learning Progress

I've made significant progress in my data analysis journey, having covered approximately 50% of the curriculum I've set for myself. Some of the key topics I've delved into include:

- **Introduction to Data Analysis:** Explored the basics of data analysis and various data types.

- **Statistical Analysis:** Gained a solid foundation in statistical concepts for data interpretation.

## Current Focus

As I continue my journey, I'll be focusing on deepening my understanding of:

- **Advanced Data Analysis Techniques:** Exploring more complex data manipulation and analysis methods.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Understanding how to apply machine learning algorithms to analyze data.
- **Real-world Projects:** Embarking on practical projects to apply my skills and showcase my abilities.
